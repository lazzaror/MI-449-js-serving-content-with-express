When I spent a summer living in downtown Detroit, this was my favorite coffee shop to go to, they also had the artisan coffee shop experience, but what was unique was that they had a garage door like bar window that opened up to the outside. So they had an indoor seating area, and a bar people on the streets could walk up to and order coffee from.
